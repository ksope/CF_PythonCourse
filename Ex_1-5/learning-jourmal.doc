1. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a software programming model that organizes software design around data and objects, rather than functions and logic. OOP is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. Other benefits of OOP include code reusability: Code can be reused through inheritance, meaning a team does not have to write the same code multiple times, modularity: Encapsulation enables objects to be self-contained, making troubleshooting and collaborative development easier and flexibility: Polymorphism enables a single function to adapt to the class it is placed in. Different objects can also pass through the same interface.
2. Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods while objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. An object can also be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behaviour. An example of an object is a phone which might have similar attributes such as a keypad, power button and screen. It could also have similar functionalities such as making calls and sending text messages. A Samsung phone can be an instance of a class Phone making it an object with template attributes and functionalities obtained from the Phone Class.
3. a) Inheritance: This is where classes can reuse code from other classes. So, rather than duplicating code from another class, a class can inherit the attributes and methods of another class which will become a parent class.
b) Polymorphism: This is where objects share the same methods but its operation can take on more than one form. This reduces the need to duplicate code. Polymorphism allows different types of objects to pass through the same interface
c) Operator Overloading: It means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. For example, operator ‘+’ is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because '+' operator is overloaded by int class and str class.
