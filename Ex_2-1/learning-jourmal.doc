1. Plain Python is great to build a simple website or web application since it does not need most of the out-of-the-box solutions that comes with Django. However, as the website grows more complex, we might need more features and functionality that plain python can’t provide. Django is made for rapid development without compromising any functionality or security issues but has a learning curve compared with plain python.
2. The significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture is in MVC architecture, you need to write the controller code yourself, whereas in MVT architecture, the Template handles the controller output. 
3. My main goal is to learn how to build a full python based web application and understand how a framework in python works. I will also like to understand how the DRY principle works in python and practice it.
