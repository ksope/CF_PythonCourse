1. Authentication is a crucial aspect of application development. It helps organizations protect their systems, data, networks, websites, and applications from attacks. It also helps individuals keep their personal data confidential, empowering them to conduct business, such as banking or investing, online with less risk.

For instance, let’s consider a scenario where a user wants to access their bank account information online. Without authentication, anyone could access the user’s account and steal their money. However, if the user is required to enter a username and password to access their account, it becomes much more difficult for an attacker to gain access to the user’s account.

Incorporating authentication into an application is essential to ensure that only authorized users can access the application’s resources. There are several methods of authentication, including cookie-based authentication, token-based authentication, and third-party access (OAuth, API-token), among others. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of authentication method depends on the specific requirements of the application. 


2. To create a login form, you will need to follow the following steps:
1. Create the view.
2. Create the template.
3. Specify the URL mapping
4. Register the URL to the project.
 

3. Function Description:

authenticate()
The Django authentication system handles both authentication and authorization.  It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. 

redirect()

Returns an HttpResponseRedirect to the appropriate URL for the arguments passed.

The arguments could be:

A model: the model’s get_absolute_url() function will be called.
A view name, possibly with arguments: reverse() will be used to reverse-resolve the name.
An absolute or relative URL, which will be used as-is for the redirect location.

include()
A function that takes a full Python import path to another URLconf module that should be “included” in this place. Optionally, the application namespace and instance namespace where the entries will be included into can also be specified.
