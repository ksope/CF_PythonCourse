Recipe Task
Data structure used to create recipe is a dictionary as it can contain multiple values of various types which is similar to the data needed to be stored in a recipe. A dictionary also allows values to be indexed by keys which means each key is unique. So this means that recipes can be stored non-sequentially as it's values are not related to each other. Allowing access to recipe values via it's index makes it much simpler.

The outer structure for 'all_recipes' will be a list as it is sequential in nature and allows easy access, adding, sorting and removing of recipe items in the list
