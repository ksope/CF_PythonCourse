1. Django is a web framework that allows developers to build web applications quickly and efficiently. Static files such as images, JavaScript, or CSS are files that do not change in a web application. In Django, we refer to these files as “static files”. Django provides django.contrib.staticfiles to help manage these files. 

To configure static files, make sure that django.contrib.staticfiles is included in your INSTALLED_APPS. In your settings file, define STATIC_URL to specify the URL where the static files will be served from.

In your templates, use the static template tag to build the URL for the given relative path using the configured staticfiles alias.

To serve the static files, you’ll also need to actually serve the static files.


2. Two Django packages from Django's official documentation:

Django REST framework: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. It provides features such as authentication, serialization, viewsets, routers, testing, etc. 
Django CMS: An easy-to-use and developer-friendly CMS platform that integrates with Django seamlessly. It allows users to create and manage content through a drag-and-drop interface.
