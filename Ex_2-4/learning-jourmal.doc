1. Django views are Python functions or class methods that take a web request and return a web response. For example, when requests a webpage such as https://homepage.com/, it’s corresponding view might be a function called “welcome” which will be mapped to return the HTML web page.
2. If I was going to reuse code in various parts of the project, I will use class-based views as they are based on Python classes which are easy to reuse and extend. This reduces code duplication.
3. A Django template language is a text document or Python string marked-up using the Django template language.
